				<h3>Challenge proposal: Spend at least 45 minutes in the sun every day</h2>

				<p>I spend most of my time on the computer every day. Like, I spend probably easily 6+ hours on a good day.</p>
				<p>Personally, I have no real issues with that. I'm mostly doing useful or at least interesting things (in my opinion)</p>
				<p>However, my mother has requested multiple times that I spend less time on the computer. So here's my attempt at that.</p>
				<br>
				<h4>Day 1 (5/20)</h4>
				<p>I've started walking around the pool for 45-60 minutes a day. It's reasonably good exercise, and it's pretty simple.</p>
				<h4>Day 2 (5/21)</h4>
				<p>I'm mostly just reading books as I walk. I've gotten reasonably good at it now (after 2 hours of practice).</p>
				<p>I can do laps around the pool while reading and not really have to think about it. It's amusing.</p>
				<h4>Day 3 (5/22)</h4>
				<p>Earlier today, before I started walking (I normally go for an hour starting at 9:30 or so) my mom found some praying mantis egg cases.</p>
				<p>Doing my best not to step on any newborn praying mantises.</p>
				<h4>Day 4 (5/23)</h4>
				<p>It's starting to get a bit hotter. I might start doing this earlier in the morning.</p>
				<p>I've been doing this before I shower, so I'm tempted to take cold showers after instead of hot ones.</p>
				<h4>Day 5 (5/24)</h4>
				<p>So far, over quarantine, I've been re-reading one of my favorite book series.</p>
				<p>It is with a heavy heart that I must announce that I am out of Bookâ„¢. I'll have to start re-reading a new series, I guess.</p>
				<h4>Day 6 (5/25)</h4>
				<p>I've started reading a new series, but I could only find it as an ebook. So I guess I'll get to squint to see my phone screen now.</p>
				<h4>Day 7 (5/26)</h4>
				<p>I think it's nice that I'm actually getting more exercise. It's helpful. I do my chores in the morning, walk for an hour, and then get to schoolwork.</p>
				<p>It pushes me to get out of bed on time, especially when I have a 11 AM TOK meeting or similar.</p>
				<h4>Day 8 (5/27)</h4>
				<p>Today was amusing. I had an english call at 11, and I'm writing this just after the english call ended.</p>
				<p>I woke up at 9:45 and decided I still wanted to walk for an hour then shower but I barely had enough time. Worked out though.</p>
				<h4>Day 9 (5/28)</h4>
				<p>My sister told me today that I'm getting tanner. She was even joking about how it's a shame that I'm tan when there's nobody to notice, since I'm at home the whole time.</p>
				<h4>Day 10 (5/29)</h4>
