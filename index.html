				<h2>Introduction</h2>

				<p>Welcome to our psych projects. We decided to host them here mainly because it was funny, but also as a lowkey (in all honesty - highkey) flex.</p>
				<p>In all honesty, your browser can probably load this webpage faster than it can load a google doc or google slides.</p>
				<p>What's the singular of google slides anyways? A google slide? That doesn't sound right, but I'm loathe to make something have the same plural as its singular.</p>
				<p>Whatever, it doesn't really matter, people are just gonna call it a powerpoint anyways.</p> 
				<p>Enjoy.</p>
