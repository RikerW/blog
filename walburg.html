				<h2>Challenge proposal: Exercise for at least 30 minutes a day</h2>

				<p>I have never been a super active person, but the quarentine has never made it worse. It turns out that when you tell a kid who usually never leaves their house that they don't need to leave their house, they won't leave their house. However, I recognize that this is probably not a good thing, and that I should try to get outside and do exercise before I turn into a puddle of gelatin. Below documents my experience with the most terrifying thing known to man: <i> Exercise</i>.</p>
				<h3> Hypothesis </h3>
				<p> The exercise will help create an outlet for my stress, reducing my cortisol and resulting in a general improved mood. This would mirror the results found in Lovallo et. Al 2006. </p>
				<br>
				<h3>Day 1 (5/21)</h3>
				<h4>Summary</h4>
				<p>Engaged in standard exercise routine which consisted of the following:
<ul><li>1.5 Mile run(14:40)</li>
<li>25 Pushups</li>
<li>30 Russian twists</li>
<li>20 Squats</li></ul>
</p>
				<h4>Reflection</h4>
				<p>This made me realize how out of shape I am, the fact that it took me this long to run a 1.5 mile. Additionally, the 25 pushups is a little too little for me. I thought this would be depressing, however, it is actually quite motivating. I know that I can definitely improve with time, and as such this is really a positive thing rather than a negative thing. I hope the 8 days will be enough to actually see this improvement.</p>
				<h4>Highlight</h4>
				<p>Going from the upward portion of my run to the flat portion was the ultimate bliss. Definitely motivates me to do it more tomorrow.</p>
				<h3>Day 2 (5/22)</h3>
				<h4>Summary</h4>
				<p>Engaged in standard exercise routine which consisted of the following:
<ul><li>1.5 Mile run(14:21)</li>
<li>27 Pushups</li>
<li>35 Russian twists</li>
<li>22 Squats</li></ul>
</p>
				<h4>Reflection</h4>
				<p>This definite improvement motivated me in a way I did not realize was possible. I definitely think this is like a zen garden. The constant repeatable task with a clear goal results in a consistent dosage of dopamine which is sorely needed in our current conditions.</p>
				<h4>Highlight</h4>
				<p>Checking my time after my run and realizing that I had beaten my previous time by 20 seconds.</p>
				<h3>Day 3 (5/23)</h3>
				<h4>Summary</h4>
				<p>Engaged in standard exercise routine which consisted of the following:
<ul><li>1.5 Mile run(14:09)</li>
<li>27 Pushups</li>
<li>36 Russian twists</li>
<li>23 Squats</li>
<li>45 Second Plank</li></ul>
</p>
				<h4>Reflection</h4>
				<p>I was a little disappointed to see relatively little improvement compared to yesterday. However, I also recognize that I'm not going to be able to see major improvement every single day. Today was also the day I introduced planking to my routine, and I think this is a positive improvement over my previous routine.</p>
				<h4>Highlight</h4>
				<p>Being done with the plank.</p>
				<h3>Day 4 (5/24)</h4>
				<h4>Summary</h4>
				<p>Engaged in standard exercise routine which consisted of the following:
<ul><li>1.5 Mile run(14:09)</li>
<li>30 Pushups</li>
<li>40 Russian twists</li>
<li>25 Squats</li>
<li>50 Second Plank</li></ul>
</p>
				<h4>Reflection</h4>
				<p>The disappointment with the lack of improvement was definitely felt today, when I had pretty much the exact same time as previously, and I only did a few more pushups and russian twists. Nonetheless, I realize that I need to continue to improve regardless. </p>
				<h4>Highlight</h4>
				<p>Finishing my run.</p>
				<h3>Day 5 (5/25)</h3>
				<h4>Summary</h4>
				<p>Engaged in standard exercise routine which consisted of the following:
<ul><li>1.5 Mile run(13:54)</li>
<li>32 Pushups</li>
<li>45 Russian twists</li>
<li>27 Squats</li>
<li>55 Second Plank</li></ul>
</p>
				<h4>Reflection</h4>
				<p>Seeing another improvement to my mile time and breaking the 14:00 mark really made my day. I seriously underestimated the positive capacity of exercise. It may just be placebo, but I personally have noticed that I feel much calmer and more satisfied than previously. </p>
				<h4>Highlight</h4>
				<p>Almost getting to a minute on my plank!</p>
				<h3>Day 6 (5/26)</h3>
				<h4>Summary</h4>
				<p>Engaged in standard exercise routine which consisted of the following:
<ul><li>1.5 Mile run(14:00)</li>
<li>30 Pushups</li>
<li>40 Russian twists</li>
<li>25 Squats</li>
<li>55 Second Plank</li></ul>
</p>
				<h4>Reflection</h4>
				<p>This was definitely the worst day for me exercise wise. I faced a regression in every category. I chose to do this because I simply felt way too tired to do what my normal routine is quickly becoming. I’m hoping that this won’t be the start of a downward spiral and that I’ll be able to recover tomorrow.</p>
				<h4>Highlight</h4>
				<p>Maintaining the 55 second plank.</p>
				<h3>Day 7 (5/27)</h3>
				<h4>Summary</h4>
				<p>Engaged in standard exercise routine which consisted of the following:
<ul><li>1.5 Mile run(13:54)</li>
<li>34 Pushups</li>
<li>50 Russian twists</li>
<li>30 Squats</li>
<li>1 Minute Plank</li></ul>
</p>
				<h4>Reflection</h4>
				<p>This was a definite recovery towards my previous progress. I’m particularly proud of the pushup count and the one minute plank. I definitely am enjoying this new schedule. I find the rigidness it brings to my life to be very helpful in these chaotic times.</p>
				<h4>Highlight</h4>
				<p>The 1.5 mile run where I was once again able to get under 14 minutes.</p>
				<h3>Day 8 (5/28)</h3>
				<h4>Summary</h4>
				<p>Engaged in standard exercise routine which consisted of the following:
<ul><li>1.5 Mile run(13:40)</li>
<li>40 Pushups</li>
<li>52 Russian twists</li>
<li>33 Squats</li>
<li>1:15 Minute Plank</li></ul>
</p>
				<h4>Reflection</h4>
				<p>This was my last day of the experiment, however it will definitely be the last day I adhere to this schedule. The level of clarity and accomplishment it has brought me cannot be overstated. I have thoroughly enjoyed this and cannot wait to continue the schedule.</p>
				<h4>Highlight</h4>
				<p>Realizing I don’t have to stop the schedule.</p>
